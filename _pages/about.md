I am a graduate student and research assistant in the [Climate-Water-Society Lab](https://wp.auburn.edu/thecwslab/), a Land-Climate Interaction Group at Auburn University. My research focuses on improving the representation of water, carbon, and energy cycle processes in land surface models to advance understanding of land–atmosphere interactions. I use perturbed parameter ensemble experiments with NEON flux tower observations to quantify model uncertainty and evaluate process behavior. The goal of this work is to integrate observations into model development to improve the representation of key land surface processes and strengthen predictions of coupled climate–water dynamics.

I am also interested in applying machine learning methods to environmental systems to better characterize and predict hydrological and climate-driven variability. This work complements process-based modeling by offering alternative perspectives on complex land–climate interactions.

I hold an MSc in Water Engineering from the [Pan African University Institute of Water and Energy Sciences (PAUWES)](https://www.pauwes.dz/), where I specialized in hydrology, climate science, and natural resource management. My undergraduate training in Earth Science at Maseno University emphasized hydrology and water resources, supported by a strong foundation in geoscience and environmental management.

In addition to academic research, I have industry experience in hydrological modeling, groundwater exploration, oil spill assessment, geotechnical investigations, hydrogeological field surveys, borehole drilling and development. These experiences strengthen my ability to connect theoretical modeling with real world water resource challenges.
