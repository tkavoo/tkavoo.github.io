I am a graduate student and research assistant in the [Climate-Water-Society Lab](https://wp.auburn.edu/thecwslab/), a Land-Climate Interaction Group at Auburn University. I am enthusiastic about conducting research in hydroclimatology, land-atmosphere interactions, and watershed modeling with a particular interest in examining the impacts of climate change and land use change on water resources.

I have diverse industry experience involving the assessment and mapping of oil spills, hydrological modeling, geotechnical and geophysical investigations, groundwater explorations and hydrogeological site investigations and borehole development.

I hold an MSc in Water Engineering from the [Pan African University Institute of Water and Energy Sciences (PAUWES)](https://www.pauwes.dz/). My coursework and research focused on hydrology, climate science, and natural resource management. My undergraduate degree in Earth Science from Maseno University with a major in Hydrology and Water Resources management, with a strong emphasis on Geoscience, natural resources management, conservation, hydrology, and information technology in both coursework and research.

I am dedicated to advancing knowledge and sustainable water resource management.
