I am a MS Natural Resource student and Graduate Research Assistant in the [Climate-Water-Society Lab](https://wp.auburn.edu/thecwslab/), a Land-Climate Interaction Group at Auburn University. I am enthusiastic about conducting research in the fields of hydroclimatology, land-atmosphere interactions, and watershed modeling with a special interest in examining the impacts of climate change and land use change on water resources and currently working on climate and land use interactions.

I have a diverse industry experience involving the assessment and mapping of oil spills, hydrological modelling, geotechnical and geophysical investigations, as well as hydrogeological site investigations and borehole development.

In 2019, I earned a Master of Science degree in Water Engineering from the [Pan African University Institute of Water and Energy Sciences (PAUWES)](https://www.pauwes.dz/), where my coursework and research focused on hydrology, climate science, and natural resource management. Prior to this, I completed a degree in Earth Science from Maseno University, where I majored in Hydrology and Water Resources management, with a strong emphasis on Geoscience, natural resources management, conservation, hydrology, and information technology in both coursework and research.
