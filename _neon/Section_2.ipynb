    "#### 2. NEON Utilities Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore how to efficiently work with **NEON** data directly from the [NEON API](http://data.neonscience.org/data-api) using the powerful tools provided by `neonUtilities`. This approach allows us to seamlessly download and organize data for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1 Choosing Your Download Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial offers two approaches for working with NEON data:\n",
    "***\n",
    "- **Downloading data directly from the NEON API (current focus):** This method retrieves data using Python and neonUtilities. You'll provide specific details about the data you want.\n",
    "- **Working with already downloaded data:** If you have NEON data locally, there are alternative methods for processing it [here](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/download-explore-neon-data).\n",
    "***\n",
    "##### 2.2 Downloading Data with zipsByProduct():\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we utilize the `zipsByProduct()` function to download specific data products from NEON. This function requires essential details such as the Data Product ID (DPID), date range, site IDs, download package type, file save path, and whether to check download size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of its arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dpID`: The data product identifier (DPID) found on the [NEON](http://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore) Explore Data page.\n",
    "- `startdate`: The start date for data retrieval in YYYY-MM format (e.g., \"2020-01\").\n",
    "- `enddate`: The end date for data retrieval in YYYY-MM format (e.g., \"2021-12\").\n",
    "- `site`: A character vector containing 4-letter site IDs (e.g., 'TALL'). You can use \"all\" for all sites.\n",
    "- `savepath`: The local directory where downloaded data will be saved. Adjust the path as needed.\n",
    "- `package`: Choose `\"basic\"` (default) or `\"expanded\"` depending on data needs.\n",
    "- `check_size`: Set to `TRUE` (default) to verify download size before proceeding, or `FALSE` to skip this check."
